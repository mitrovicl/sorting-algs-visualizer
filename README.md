# sorting-algs-visualizer
Sorting algorithms visualizer made with C++ (Qt Framework)

To do:
  1. Add an option to change colors
  2. Add an option to sort N times in a row, and get average time (and all independent times).
  3. Add more algorithms
  4. Add "pause" and "continue" buttons
  5. Find a way to get faster rendering (OpenGL maybe).
  6. Rewrite the code to be more readable.
