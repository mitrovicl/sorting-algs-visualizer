How to execute the program (currently only on Windows):
  1. Download this repository
  2. Go to executables > Windows
  3. Double click on SortVisualizer.exe

Currently available algorithms:
  1. Selection sort
  2. Bubble sort
  3. Insertion sort
  4. Merge sort
  5. Quick sort

To do:
  1. Add an option to change colors
  2. Add an option to sort N times in a row, and get average time (and all independent times).
  3. Add more algorithms
  4. Add "pause" and "continue" buttons
  5. Find a way to get faster rendering (OpenGL maybe).
  6. Rewrite the code to be more readable.
